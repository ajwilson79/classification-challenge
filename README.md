# Module 13 Challenge - Spam Detector

This Jupyter Notebook contains code for building and evaluating machine learning models to detect spam emails. The goal is to create two classification models, a Logistic Regression model and a Random Forest Classifier model, and compare their performance on a dataset containing email features and labels (spam or not spam).

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed, including pandas, scikit-learn, and jupyter notebook.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the `spam_detector.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, create and train the models, and evaluate their performance.
5. The notebook includes markdown cells for predictions, explanations, and results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook is available at https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m13/challenge/spam-data.csv and is automatically loaded by the code. The dataset contains various features related to emails, such as word frequencies, character frequencies, and capital run lengths, along with a binary label indicating whether the email is spam or not.
